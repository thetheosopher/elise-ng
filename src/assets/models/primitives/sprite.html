<p>The <b>Sprite</b> element is a general purpose element used to display bitmap
image sources and is a key component for creating animations and other multistate elements.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Image element, the <b>Sprite</b> element supports an array of frames,
each of which defines a separate image source to be displayed in the element.</p>
<p>Each frame may specify a separate image source and/or a separate part of the source image to be
displayed.  The frameIndex may be updated at runtime based either on user activity or in
a timed manner for animations.</p>
