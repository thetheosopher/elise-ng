<p></p><b>Models</b> define a rectangular surface for rendering other elements and provide a
reference point for media resources used by the elements rendered on their
surface.  Models are also elements and can be embedded in other models to
compose more complex drawings.</p>
<p>
Models can be both stroked with an outer border and filled with a background
that is rendered beneath all of its elements.</p>
