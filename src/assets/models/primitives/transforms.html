<p><b>Transforms</b> are used to alter the coordinate space in which elements are
rendered without altering their original definition.  This permits applying
effects including scaling, rotation, translation.</p>
<p>The point around which a transform is applied may be specified for some
transitions like scale and rotate.</p>
<p>This sample demonstrates applying a couple different transforms to the same
source rectangle element.</p>
